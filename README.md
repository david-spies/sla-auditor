📝 Shadow-Logic Auditor (SLA) Starter Kit
Overview

The Shadow-Logic Auditor (SLA) is a 2026-standard development tool designed to prevent "AI-driven technical debt." It intercepts LLM-generated code (from Claude, ChatGPT, or Gemini), audits it against your project’s specific architectural rules, and automatically refactors violations before they hit your main branch.

🚀 Quick Start

    Initialize SLA: Run npx sla-cli init to scan your stack and generate .sla/rules.yaml.

    Configure Provider: Add your ANTHROPIC_API_KEY or OPENAI_API_KEY to your environment.

    Install IDE Plugin: (Optional) Install the VS Code / Cursor extension to catch violations in real-time.

    CI Integration: Add the provided GitHub Action to enforce rules on every Pull Request.
